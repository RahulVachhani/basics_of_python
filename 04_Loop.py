# Loops

# For Loop

for i in range(11):          # Syntax of for loop
    print(i)                 # its print 0 to 10 using range function with for loop
        



# While Loop

a = 0 
while a < 11:           # When we know only condition , not iteration number then we use while loop
    print(a)
    a = a + 1
